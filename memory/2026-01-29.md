# Memory — 2026-01-29

- **Date:** 2026-01-29
- **Summary:** First session in this workspace. No existing `memory/` files were present before today. I inspected and read the workspace onboarding and planning files to capture context.

- **Files reviewed:**
  - `SOUL.md`
  - `USER.md`
  - `AGENTS.md`
  - `BOOTSTRAP.md`
  - `HEARTBEAT.md`
  - `planning.md`
  - `todo.md`
  - `reports/next-session.md`
  - `inactive-docs/CRM_Planning_Review_v2.md`

- **Actions taken:**
  1. Located and opened the files above to surface prior conversation and planning notes.
  2. Created this memory file to record the session.
  3. Updated the in-repo todo list tracking these steps.

- **Notes / Next steps (suggested):**
  - Update `USER.md` and `IDENTITY.md` with human and assistant identity details (from bootstrap flow).
  - If you want, I can append a running log here as we continue the session (daily notes).

- **Session log (brief):**
  - 11:xx — Searched for `memory/` files (none found)
  - 11:xx — Read onboarding and planning docs listed above
  - 11:xx — Created `memory/2026-01-29.md`
## Environment & Tooling

- OS: macOS
- Primary project path: ~/dev/claude-projects/honey-book
- VS Code is the single working window
- Clawdbot gateway runs in system Terminal (not VS Code terminal)
- Clawdbot dashboard accessed at http://127.0.0.1:18789/
- ChatGPT is used for planning/execution guidance
- Claude Code / GitHub Copilot used only for repo-aware code edits

## Repo State (Start of Implementation)

- Repository initially contained planning/docs only
- No Rails app existed prior to this session
- Decision: generate Rails API app in-place (repo root)
- planning.md is the source of truth
- CRM_Planning_Review_v2.md archived (inactive-docs)

## Ruby / Rails Decision

- System Ruby version found: 2.6.10 (too old for Rails 7)
- Decision: upgrade Ruby via Homebrew (no sudo, no system Ruby changes)
- Target: Ruby 3.x + Rails 7.x
- Next step after this memory entry: install Homebrew Ruby, then install Rails

## Workflow Rules

- ChatGPT handles sequencing, decisions, and “what/why/next”
- Copilot/Claude Code handles “edit this file / generate this code”
- Copilot does not have chat memory; only reads repo files
- `memory/*.md` is the only long-term memory for the coding assistant
